## Why I've never attempted to learn Game Engine development
### A story of self-sabotage and self-doubt

I have been playing with basic game development since I turned 14. My friend [Henry](https://github.com/karlek) introduced me to SDL during our second year of gymnasiet. I played around with it for a few weekends, and then basically gave up due to the
**harsh** learning curve.

During my entire school time I wasn't the most keen to study, and especially not to study math. Ironically the major I chose in school was Technology (Networks & Programming), which included all math classes available in the Swedish school system. Long story short, I got the lowest grade possible (G) in each class and decided to stay as far away as possible from any academic

At that point I had just started my programming career doing websites for a friend of my mother, and doing basic web development for users on MMOwned (now [OwnedCore](https://ownedcore.com)). This field of programming was a lot easier than game development at the time, and made it much easier not give up at the first bump on the road.

I had already taught myself enough about web development to work with it professionally, which is exactly what I did. Back then everyone essentially worked in PHP or ASP.net and it was very easy to get up and running. I could get around any optimization or "algorithmic" issue by pure trial and error, and learned to work around them rather than learning how things actually work.

#### Fast forward to today
I still tend to take the least-complex path when getting into new projects. A part of me is proud of being quite the Jack of all Trades, having worked professionally as:
* Entrepreneur (Zerebra and a few part time businesses)
* Fullstack Web Developer (Zerebra)
* Linux Sys Admin & Site Reliability Engineer (King)
* Cloud Architect (Jetstack)
* Technical Sales (Jetstack)
* Back-end Engineer (Embark Studios)

Another part of me is not proud, but rather irritated. Despite of the different environments of different scale and complexity, I have never tried to specialize in anything.
When I spoke about it with my psychologist earlier this year, we discovered that I tend to stay away from anything that scares me. In a way, my mindset is to just keep doing that which you are already good at, and make sure you are not exposing your weaknesses and never experience discomfort.

In hindsight, it makes a lot of sense to me why Web Development is what I have ended up doing for most of my career. The barrier of entry is lower than almost any other technical area, there's unlimited content online and  iteration times are pretty much instant.
Compare that with a more technically challenging area like Game Engine development. So far I have minimum experience in this area, but so far I feel that taking the first steps is a very daunting journey without someone holding my hand. And thus, I felt it's unlikely that I will ever do a real attempt to produce anything.

#### Deciding to change my mindset
For me, realizing that the only thing preventing me from learning more was my fear of failing was the first step towards changing.

So... Last week I, for the hundredth time until now, decided to follow some basic Learn OpenGL and LearnWGPU tutorials to dip my feet in making [my own Game Engine](https://github.com/bittermandel/bitter-engine). So far I've setup a model viewer that renders 10x10 boxes with different rotation and a directional light that moves slightly each frame. It's definitely been a challenge getting lighting and shadows to render properly, while learning the WebGPU API, GLSL and linear algebra at the same time. Perhaps this is too hard for my web-dev mind in the end...

One day last week I made some major progress with my small model viewer. I managed to implement a Phong lighting model without copying too much code #proud
I shared some of that progress with my new colleagues at #EmbarkStudios and a kind soul asked me if I can share my journey in a blog!

That gave me enough motivation to sit down for a few hours and write down what my motivations actually are. The area of game development is incredibly exciting and interesting, and I keep going back to it with bursts of motivation. So why not give it a **real** chance and write a little bit about it?

What's the worst that can happen? :)
