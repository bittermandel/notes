## Why I've never attempted to learn Game Engine development
### A story of self-sabotage and self-doubt

I have been playing with basic game development since I turned 14. My friend [Henry](https://github.com/karlek) introduced me to SDL during our second year of gymnasiet. I played around with it for a few weekends, and then basically gave up due to the
**harsh** learning curve.

During my entire school time I wasn't the most keen to study, and especially not to study math. Ironically the major I chose in school was Technology (Networks & Programming), which included all math classes available in the Swedish school system. Long story short, I got the lowest grade possible (G) in each class and decided to stay as far away as possible from any academic

At that point I had just started my programming career doing websites for a friend of my mother, and doing basic web development for users on MMOwned (now [OwnedCore](https://ownedcore.com)). This field of programming was a lot easier than game development at the time, and made it much easier not give up at the first bump on the road.

I had already taught myself enough about web development to work with it professionally, which is exactly what I did. Back then everyone essentially worked in PHP or ASP.net and it was very easy to get up and running. I could get around any optimization or "algorithmic" issue by pure trial and error, and learned to work around them rather than learning how things actually work.

Fast forward to today, and I still tend to take the least-complex path when getting into new projects. A part of me is proud of being quite the Jack of all Trades, having worked professionally as:
* Entrepreneur (Zerebra, 5+ part time businesses)
* Fullstack Web Developer (Zerebra)
* Linux Sys Admin & Site Reliability Engineer (King)
* Cloud Architect (Jetstack)
* Technical Sales (Jetstack)
* Back-end Engineer (Embark Studios)

Another part of me is not. Despite of the different environments of different scale and complexity, I have never tried to specialize within anything.
When I thought about it together with my psychologist earlier this year, we discovered together that I have stayed away from anything that scared me. Just keep doing whatever you're already good at, and make sure you're not exposing your weaknesses and never experience discomfort.

In hindsight, it makes a lot of sense to me why Web Development and Entrepreneurship is what I ended up doing.
* Showing off the result of your work is easy and standardized.
* Iteration times are fast.
* The barrier of entry is lower than almost any other technical area.
* And most importantly, it's always appreciated by others.

Compare that with a more technically challenging area like Game Engine development. So far I have minimum experience in this area, but what I can make out is that:
* Iteration times are much slower, by multiple orders of magnitude.
* Taking the first steps is a very daunting journey without hand-holding.
* Prerequisite knowledge within Math is required.
* Much fewer people know what's going on.
